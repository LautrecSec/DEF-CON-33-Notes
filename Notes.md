## How This Will Evolve
- **Pending Talks:** Once DEF CON publishes the full, official videos, I’ll capture the video link, precise duration, and integrate them into each section above.
- **Categorization:** I’ve grouped talks into logical buckets (Automotive & Embedded Security, Automotive/IoT & EV, Industrial & Infrastructure, Infrastructure/ICS, Contests, etc.). If you’d like refined topics (e.g., creating an “AppSec” or “Cloud Security” category), just say so and we’ll adjust.
- **Markdown Readiness:** This layout is ready for you to start annotating or storing notes. It’s primed to become your personal, topic-driven learning path.

Once DEF CON drops the full talks on YouTube, I’ll loop back in to fill in the metadata and polish the file. Sound like the right cadence for your flow?
